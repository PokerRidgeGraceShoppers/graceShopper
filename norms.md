In light of group disagreements:
  - Comminucate your ideas to your partner
  - If we can't decide take it to the group
  - finally take it to our fellow or instructor

What to do if you find yourself frustrated
  - Take a 5 minute break
  - Communicate frustration to the group
  - Address any ongoing frustrations in our stand up

What does our group do when merging work
  - create a new branch before starting any new features
  - Pull down changes from master
  - Complete merge conflicts in local repo
  - Commit changes and push up changes to branch
  - Create a pull request and request a review by all teammates
  - Requested teammate reviews changes and makes comments
  - Make changes as needed
  - approve changes, merge pull request and delete old branch

When do we ask for help
  - Work with pair on bug ~ 20 min
  - If you aren't making any progress solve the problem with team
    * Google search errors
    * diagram problem

  - Ask fellow to look into the issue with you
  - Escalate the issue to John/Dakota

How do we pair
  - One pair session in the morining and one in the afternoon
  - modular switching of drivers and navigators
  - rotate pair schedule

After hours work
  - Slack out a message to your team "I am working on this feature"
  - You MUST be ok with the group turning down your work and potentially
    wasting your own time

What time do we do daily stand up
  - Anywhere between 10-1030a and end of day
